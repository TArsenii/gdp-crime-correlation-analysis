> **Research Question:** *"Does GDP level of a country influence the type of crime committed within its borders, or are there better socio-economic factors that can measure crime patterns?"*

## üéØ **Project Overview**

This repository presents a comprehensive 68-page academic analysis investigating the complex relationship between economic prosperity and criminal activity across 181+ countries. The research challenges conventional assumptions about GDP as the primary predictor of crime rates and explores alternative socio-economic indicators.

### **Key Research Scope:**
- **181 countries** analyzed across multiple years (1999-2023)
- **6 research questions** covering different aspects of crime-economy relationship
- **15+ socio-economic indicators** including GDP, happiness index, corruption, unemployment
- **Multiple crime categories** from violent crimes to cybercrime and environmental crimes

## üî¨ **Research Questions & Methodology**

### **RQ1: GDP vs Violent Crimes**
*Does high GDP per capita correlate with decreased violent or assault crimes?*
- **Methodology:** Quartile-based analysis of GDP groups vs homicide/kidnapping rates
- **Key Finding:** Counter-intuitive relationship discovered between wealth and certain crime types

### **RQ2: Temporal Crime-GDP Dynamics** 
*Is there immediate change in crime rate after GDP fluctuation or a lagging phase?*
- **Methodology:** Time-series analysis of GDP fluctuations vs crime rate changes
- **Key Finding:** Significant lag effects identified in crime response to economic changes

### **RQ3: Corruption vs Property Crimes**
*Do countries with high corruption scores have fewer robbery/theft cases?*
- **Methodology:** Corruption Perceptions Index correlation with property crime rates
- **Key Finding:** Complex non-linear relationship between institutional corruption and street crime

### **RQ4: GDP vs Cybercrime Disparities**
*Are there significant differences in cyber-related crimes across GDP levels?*
- **Methodology:** Digital crime analysis across economic development tiers
- **Key Finding:** Strong positive correlation between economic development and cybercrime rates

### **RQ5: Beyond GDP - Alternative Predictors**
*Are there macroeconomic factors that influence crime more than GDP?*
- **Methodology:** Multi-variate analysis of happiness, inequality, unemployment vs crime
- **Key Finding:** Happiness index and inequality coefficient show stronger predictive power than GDP

### **RQ6: Happiness-Unemployment Crime Patterns**
*Do countries with high happiness/unemployment have specific crime prevalence?*
- **Methodology:** Cross-factor analysis of psychological and economic indicators
- **Key Finding:** Unique crime signatures identified for different happiness-employment combinations

## üìä **Key Research Insights**

### **üö® Counter-Intuitive Discoveries:**

#### **1. The GDP Paradox**
- **High GDP countries** show increased rates of certain crime types (cybercrime, white-collar)
- **Economic prosperity** doesn't uniformly reduce all crime categories
- **Wealth concentration** may create new criminal opportunities

#### **2. Happiness Index Superiority**
- **Happiness Index** proves to be a stronger crime predictor than GDP
- **Psychological well-being** correlates more strongly with violent crime reduction
- **Social satisfaction** impacts crime patterns more than economic metrics

#### **3. Corruption Complexity**
- **High institutional corruption** doesn't always correlate with high street crime
- **Systematic corruption** may actually reduce certain types of opportunistic crime
- **Rule of law** shows different patterns than corruption perceptions

#### **4. Digital Divide in Crime**
- **Cybercrime rates** increase dramatically with economic development
- **Digital infrastructure** creates new criminal opportunities
- **Technology access** correlates with sophisticated crime types

### **üåç Global Crime Patterns Identified:**

#### **Low GDP Countries Pattern:**
- **High violent crime** rates (homicide, assault)
- **Low cybercrime** due to limited digital infrastructure
- **Survival-driven** criminal activities predominate

#### **Medium GDP Countries Pattern:**
- **Mixed crime portfolio** with both traditional and modern crimes
- **Transitional criminal patterns** as economies develop
- **Highest crime diversity** across all categories

#### **High GDP Countries Pattern:**
- **Low violent crime** but high sophisticated crime
- **Cybercrime hotspots** with advanced digital criminal networks
- **White-collar crime** prevalence increases significantly

## üîß **Research Methodology**

### **Data Sources & Scale:**
- **United Nations Office on Drugs & Crime** - Primary crime statistics
- **World Bank & Kaggle** - GDP and economic indicators  
- **Our World in Data** - Democracy and development metrics
- **The Global Economy** - Happiness, inequality, corruption indices
- **Numbeo (scraped)** - Crime perception indices
- **Wikipedia (scraped)** - Recent GDP data (2023)

### **Data Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Data Collection** - Multi-source aggregation from 6+ databases
2. **Data Cleaning** - Country name standardization, missing value handling
3. **Data Integration** - Country+Year key merging across datasets
4. **Normalization** - Per capita calculations for fair cross-country comparison
5. **Statistical Analysis** - Correlation analysis, regression modeling, quartile grouping

### **Advanced Analytical Techniques:**
- **Quartile-based GDP grouping** for comparative analysis
- **Time-lag correlation analysis** for temporal relationships
- **Multi-variate regression** for factor importance ranking
- **Cross-correlation matrices** for indicator relationships

## üìà **Statistical Rigor**

### **Sample Size & Coverage:**
- **181 countries** with complete GDP data
- **24-year timespan** (1999-2023) for temporal analysis
- **15+ indicators** per country-year observation
- **Multiple crime categories** for comprehensive coverage

### **Data Quality Measures:**
- **Missing data handling** with statistical interpolation where appropriate
- **Outlier detection** and treatment for robust analysis
- **Cross-validation** across multiple data sources
- **Temporal consistency** checks for data reliability
